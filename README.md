# SimpleAutoencoder
Before Learning about GANS(Generative adverserial network) it is important to understand what is an autoencoder, So in simple intitution/terms autoencoder contains two parts namely
encoder and decoder encoder compresses the data into a latent space(nothing but a simple representation of the input) and decoder decodes the given input from this latent space.
